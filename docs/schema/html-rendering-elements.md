# HTML-Rendering Elements

 
  
 **Applies to:** SharePoint 2016 | SharePoint Foundation 2013 | SharePoint Online | SharePoint Server 2013
  
Collaborative Application Markup Language (CAML) has two major kinds of elements: those for field rendering and schema definition, and those for page (HTML) rendering. The page-rendering CAML elements are designed for use in rendering pages, such as when you need to extract the property of a specific field and render it on a page.
  
Elements can be used in two ways. Elements such as the [Today](query-schema/today-element-query.md) element are used to generate a text string to be inserted within the page. Other elements are used to modify text generated by their child elements. Elements can also be concatenated to produce a concatenation of their output.
