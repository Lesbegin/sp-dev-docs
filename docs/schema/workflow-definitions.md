# Workflow Definitions

**Applies to**: SharePoint 2016 | SharePoint Foundation 2013 | SharePoint Online | SharePoint Server 2013

Each element manifest that defines a workflow must adhere to the Workflow Definition Schema. A workflow definition is an XML file that contains the information that SharePoint Foundation requires to instantiate and run the workflow, such as the following:

- The name, GUID, and description of the workflow

- The URLs of any custom forms used in this workflow

- The names of the workflow assembly, and the class within that assembly to call

- Optionally, any custom metadata the workflow requires to run

The structure of the workflow definition schema is as follows.

- [Elements Element (Workflow)](elements-element-workflow.md)

- [Workflow Element (Elements)](workflow-element-elements.md)

- [Categories Element (Workflow)](categories-element-workflow.md)

- [AssociationData Element (Workflow)](associationdata-element-workflow.md)

- [MetaData Element (Workflow)](metadata-element-workflow.md)

- [InitiationType Element (Workflow)](initiationtype-element-workflow.md)

- [Modification\_GUID\_Name Element (Workflow)](modification_guid_name-element-workflow.md)

- [StatusPageUrl Element (Workflow)](statuspageurl-element-workflow.md)

- [ExtendedStatusColumnValues Element (Workflow)](extendedstatuscolumnvalues-element-workflow.md)

- [StatusColumnValue Element (Workflow)](statuscolumnvalue-element-workflow.md)
